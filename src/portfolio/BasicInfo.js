        Hello! Iâ€™m <strong>Sukhsimran Kaur</strong>, a student at Red River Polytechnic College, Winnipeg.
        I am currently pursuing my studies in full stack web development with a strong passion
        for crafting beautiful and functional digital experiences. My journey into tech has been fueled
        by curiosity, creativity, and a constant desire to improve.
      </p>

      <p>
        My key strengths include strong problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and the ability to
        adapt quickly to new technologies. I particularly enjoy working on projects where I can combine
        <em> clean, responsive design </em> with smooth, efficient functionality.
